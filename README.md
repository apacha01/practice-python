# Python study

A study on the python language based on [this](https://roadmap.sh/python) roadmap.

## Repository Structure

In this repo you'll find:
* A `python.md` file: where i just type what i learn (it will be python specific since i already know how to program).
* A `numpy.md` file: where i just get the basics covered and to move to pandas.
* A `pandas.md` file: where i will be writing what i learn on the pandas library.
* A `practice-files` directory: where some i'll be doing some tests and trying features/functionalities of the language.
* A `google-education` directory: where i'll be solving the exercises in [google's python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python).
