# Python study

A study on the python language for Data Analysis. The basic study of python is based on [this roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) while the data analysis topics (numpy and pandas) are based on the ['Python for Data Analysis' book](https://wesmckinney.com/book/).

I also included some practice files from [Google for Education python section](https://developers.google.com/edu/python), [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and just some random tests that i though of.

## Repository Structure

In this repo you'll find:
* A `python.md` file: where i just type what i learn (it will be python specific since i already know how to program).
* A `numpy.md` file: where i just get the basics covered and to move to pandas.
* A `pandas.md` file: where i will be writing what i learn on the pandas library.
* A `practice-files` directory: where some i'll be doing some tests and trying features/functionalities of the language.
* A `google-education` directory: where i'll be solving the exercises in [google's python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python).
